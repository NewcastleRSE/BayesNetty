*subsection-title* Parameter file */subsection-title*

*
There are many different things that BayesNetty can do, each of these different things is referred to as a *q* task */q*. The parameter file defines which tasks BayesNetty will perform and the order in which they are executed. With the exception of the basic options in *ref* basic-options */ref*, all options in the parameter file define tasks. For example, a task to input some continuous data may be given as follows: 
*

*codeexample*
-input-data
-input-data-name myGreatData
-input-data-file example-cts.dat
-input-data-cts
-input-data-ids 1
*/codeexample*

*
There are a few basic rules for parameter files: 
*

*numlist*

*item* Each option must be written on a separate line.

*item* Each line that does not start with a dash, *q* - */q*, will be ignored, thus allowing comments to be written.

*item* The task must first be declared and then followed by any options for the task. 

*item* An option for a task is always written by first writing the name of the task. For example, the task option to give the name of an input data file is given by *code* -input-data-file */code*, which begins with *code* -input-data */code*, the name of the task to input data.

*item* A task, *code* XXX */code*, may always be given a task name with the option *code* XXX-name */code*. The task may then be referenced by other tasks (if permitted). This may be useful if there is more than one network.

*item* Tasks are executed in order, so any tasks that depend on other tasks must be ordered accordingly.

*item* Any tasks that require a network will be default use the previously defined network. Therefore, if there is only one network it is not necessary to name or reference it. By default tasks are name *q* Task-n */q*, where n is the number of the task.

*/numlist*

*
The following is an extract from an example parameter file where a network is referenced by a task to calculate the network score:
*

*codeexample*

...

# This is my comment
-input-network
-input-network-name myNetwork
-input-network-file network-model.dat

-calc-network-score
-calc-network-score-network-name myNetwork
*/codeexample*

*
The parameter file could be thought of as in an *code* R */code* programming style, such that the above would look as follows:
*

*codeexample*

...

# This is my comment
myNetwork<-input.network(file = "network-model.dat")

calc.network.score(network.name = myNetwork)
*/codeexample*

*
However, as BayesNetty is not an *code* R */code* package (or a programming language), the parameter file uses an unambiguous, longhand, and easy to parse style of syntax.
*

*
The options for all the different tasks may be found in the different task sections of the documentation.
*

*
Example data and parameter files can be found in the file *html* <a href="example.zip">example.zip</a> */html* *tex* example.zip */tex* . The example parameter file, *code* paras-example.txt */code*, can be used to perform a simple analysis by typing
*

*codeexample*
 ./bayesnetty paras-example.txt
*/codeexample*

*
The following shows the *code* paras-example.txt */code* file 
*

*codeexample*
#input continuous data

#search network models

*
The parameter file instructs BayesNetty to perform 4 tasks: (i) load continuous data from file *code* example-cts.dat */code*; (ii) load discrete data from file *code* example-discrete.dat */code*; (iii) load SNP data to be treated as discrete data from file *code* example.bed */code*; and finally (iv) search the network models. The screen output, which is also saved to a log file, will look something as follows:

*section-title* Parallel BayesNetty */section-title*


* It is possible to run BayesNetty using Open MPI (*cite* openmpi */cite*), which is an open source Message Passing Interface (MPI) (*cite* mpi */cite*) implementation designed for parallel programming. 
*

*
The parallel version of Bayesnetty speeds up the search through network space for the best network by simultaneously evaluating different networks. This is particularly useful for large networks and any type of analysis that depends on network searches, such as network averaging and imputing data.
*

*
A much faster way to calculate an average network in parallel is given in *ref* average-network-parallel */ref*.
*

*
A much faster way to impute network data in parallel is given in *ref* impute-parallel-example */ref*. 
*

*
After installing Open MPI on your system if it is not already installed, see *cite* openmpi */cite*, a parallel version of BayesNetty needs to be compiled. This can be done by firstly uncommenting a few lines in the *code* main.h */code* file. So that the following:
*

*codeexample*
// Comment out if not using Open MPI for parallel processing
//#ifndef USING_OPEN_MPI
//#define USING_OPEN_MPI
//#endif //OPEN_MPI
*/codeexample*

*
becomes
*

*codeexample*
// Comment out if not using Open MPI for parallel processing
#ifndef USING_OPEN_MPI
#define USING_OPEN_MPI
#endif //OPEN_MPI
*/codeexample*

*
then compile the parallel code as follows:
*

*codeexample*
mpicxx -O3 -o pbayesnetty *.cpp
*/codeexample*

* 
The code can then be ran using how many processes that you wish, for example to run with 12 processes use
*

*codeexample*
mpirun -n 12 ./pbayesnetty paras-example.txt
*/codeexample*

*
For such a trivial example the code will not run any quicker, and in fact for very small networks one may find that analyses take longer. There is some overhead in using the MPI libraries, so if trivial networks are used there may be no speed up.
*

*
Even for large networks the optimal number of processes to perform the analysis as quick as possible may not be as many processes as you can use. As there is an overhead for processes the best amount to use may be a lot, but not too many...  The best amount will vary depending on the analysis, the data and the computing system that you are using, so some trial and error may be needed.
*

*
The output will show the number of processes as well as the random seed. If you wish to reproduce exactly the same results both of these need to be set to the same value. The seed is set with the *code* -seed */code* option.

Another way of handling discrete data is with the use of *i* factors */i*. Indicator variables are created, one for each different discrete category minus one. These are treated as continuous explanatory variables in the linear regressions when they are parent nodes. A restriction of using discrete data with factors is that they cannot be child nodes of other nodes. Input by using the *code* -input-data */code* task, setting the data file and setting the data file to factor. For example, the following

Missing data is determined by any data matching the given missing value as defined by *code* -input-data-discrete-missing-value */code* and *code* -input-data-cts-missing-value */code* when inputting discrete and continuous data respectively (or *code* -input-data-factor-missing-value */code* when inputting factor data). When continuous data has an invalid entry this will also be set to missing, for example a value of *q* NaN */q* will be set to missing since a numerical value is required. Missing data for SNP data is given as defined by the PLINK *html* <a href="http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/binary.shtml">binary</a>&nbsp; */html* *tex* binary */tex* pedigree format. When there is missing data for a node for a certain individual then data for this certain individual is considered as missing for *i* every */i* node in the network. Therefore the amount of missing data depends on which nodes are in the network.

*subsection-title* Black lists */subsection-title*

* A black list can be given using the *code* -input-network-blacklist-file */code* option to define a list of edges that must not be included in any network. The text file should be formatted as follows: *

*codeexample*
node1 node2
node2 node1
node1 node3
*/codeexample*

*
such that the two nodes of each blacklisted edge are on one line. The nodes are ordered so the first line states that the edge node1 to node2 is not permitted. The next line states that the edge in the reverse direction is also not permitted.
*

*
Any searches will ignore these blacklisted edges and attempting to use a network with a blacklisted edge will result in the edge being removed.
*

*
Edges between different types of nodes may also be blacklisted. This can be done using the *code* -input-network-blacklist-edge-type */code* option. It can be used as follows:
*

*codeexample*
-input-data
-input-data-name horses
-input-data-file horses.dat
-input-data-cts

-input-data
-input-data-name whips
-input-data-file whips.dat
-input-data-cts

-input-network
-input-network-name race
-input-network-file model.dat
-input-network-blacklist-edge-type horses whips 
*/codeexample*

*
Firstly the different node types must be loaded separately and given names using the *code* -input-data-name */code* option. Then, when initially loading a network, the *code* -input-network-blacklist-edge-type */code* can be used to forbid any edge from one data set to another data set (or the same data if desired). In the above example the network may not have any edge that goes from a horse to a whip, that is, a whip node may not have a horse node as a parent. In any search that is performed these edges will not be considered.

node1 node2
node2 node1
*/codeexample*

*
such that the two nodes of each whitelisted edge are on one line. The nodes are ordered so the first line states that the edge node1 to node3 must be included. If both directions are included between two nodes then the edge must be included but may be in any direction.
*

If the whitelist and blacklist contradict one another then an error will be given.

The default and recommended Bayesian network in BayesNetty is given by the bnlearn algorithm. All future extensions are intended to be built upon this approach. For a given data set and network structure the likelihood can be calculated under specific distributional assumptions, namely that discrete nodes follow a multinomial distribution and continuous nodes a normal distribution, with distributional parameters determined by the values of the incoming parent nodes. The manner in which the likelihood is calculated can vary between Bayesian network algorithms.

*
The deal Bayesian network approach was developed by *cite* deal */cite* as an approach to model mixed discrete/continuous networks. It calculates the likelihood differently to bnlearn. However we found several issues with the method, not least that it is no longer actively supported. Therefore, it is not recommended to use a deal network for network analyses and is included only for comparison purposes.

When analysis is performed with a deal network the imaginary sample size (ISS) must be set. The ISS reflects how much confidence
we have in the (in)dependencies expressed in the assumed prior network. This can be set using the *code* -input-network-imaginary-sample-size */code* option, see *ref* input-network-options */ref*. The results given by deal have been found to be very sensitive to the setting of this parameter and there is no obvious *q* good */q* default setting.

The network score is used as a measure of how well the network model describes the data and is used to compare different models when searching through models. By convention the lower the score the better the model is and is typically based on the negative log likelihood. This is calculated assuming that discrete nodes follow a multinomial distribution and continuous nodes a normal distribution. BayesNetty considers the network score to be a property of the network and its method of calculation is set using the option *code* -input-network-score */code*, see *ref* input-network */ref*.

The above output shows the data input and then two networks input with the same structure but with different scores. The network with the BIC score is evaluated firstly, as by default the most recent network is used unless otherwise stated. The network using the log likelihood is then calculated by using the *code* -calc-network-score-network-name */code* option to specify which network should be used.

The likelihood is calculated under specific distributional assumptions, namely that discrete nodes follow a multinomial distribution and continuous nodes a normal distribution, with distributional parameters determined by the values of the incoming parent nodes. We call the network structure with its corresponding distributional parameters the posterior.
*

*
If only the posterior is of interest then the *code* -calc-posterior */code* option can be used without the need to perform any other analyses. One would probably want to also use the *code* -output-posteriors */code* option to output the posteriors, see *ref* output-posteriors */ref*.

The posterior is calculated by simply using the *code* -calc-posterior */code* option in the parameter file after the data and network has been set up. For example:

#calculate the posterior of the network
-calc-posterior
*/codeexample*


*
Note that the network has not been set for the *code* -calc-posterior */code* task as there is only one network, and so by default the most recent network is used. This parameter file, *code* paras-calc-post.txt */code*, can be found in *html* <a href="example.zip">example.zip</a>&nbsp; */html* *tex* example.zip */tex* and produces the following output:

The primary usage of BayesNetty is to calculate an average network as described in this section. An average network can be calculated using the methods described by *cite* bnlearn */cite*. In brief, a bootstrap sample (with replacement) of the data is taken and a network search is used to find a best fit network. The process is repeated *i* k */i* times and the resulting *i* k */i* networks are averaged to give a final average network, in which the edge strengths represent the proportion of replicates in which that edge appeared.

*
An alternative method for computing the average network instead of bootstrapping the data is available using the *code* -average-networks-use-score-method */code* option. This method requires calculating the likelihoods of every possible network and is therefore more accurate but takes much more time to compute. For large networks this can normally be unfeasible to calculate within acceptable time limits. Investigations comparing the two approaches for small networks found no major differences between the two approaches.

The edges are drawn proportional to the edge strength (but scaled to be between the minimum and maximum edge widths), that is, the proportion of best fit networks that the edge appears in after bootstrapping. Although using the *code* -average-networks-use-weight-method */code* option the strength can be weighted using the chi square values of each edge significance. The direction indicates the proportion of times the edge points in the given direction when it appears in a best fit network. The edges are labelled in red with the strength values followed by the direction values in brackets. Edges between discrete and continuous nodes do not have a direction value as they are constrained to be from the discrete node to the continuus node. The plot can easily be updated to your needs by following the *html* <a href="http://igraph.org">igraph</a>&nbsp; */html* *tex* igraph */tex* R package documentation. 
*

*
A graph may also be output to show the cumulative number of edges in the average network for different strength thresholds. If an edge has a strength greater than the strength threshold then it is included in the average network.

*
As calculating the average network is a computationally intensive task, it makes sense it calculate it in parallel. This can be done by running the parallel version of BayesNetty as described in *ref* parallel */ref*, but a much quicker way is given here by running the non-parallel version of BayesNetty in parallel and then combining the individual average network results in one final average network.
*


*
The handy Unix script *code* runCalcAveNetPara */code* can be ran to do this as follows:
*

*codeexample*
./runCalcAveNetPara paras-average-parallel.txt average-network-example 20
*/codeexample*

*
Where the first argument is a BayesNetty parameter file to calculate an average network, as below for example. The second argument is the file name of the average network to output, and the last argument is the number of processes to run in parallel. This will run 50 times 20 bootstraps (equal to 1000 bootstraps) overall to calculate the average network. 
*

*codeexample*
#input continuous data
-input-data
-input-data-file example-cts.dat
-input-data-cts

#input discrete data
-input-data
-input-data-file example-discrete.dat

#input SNP data as discrete data

-input-data-file example.bed
-input-data-discrete-snp

#calculate average network
-average-networks
-average-networks-bootstraps 50
*/codeexample*

*
The linux script *code* runCalcAveNetPara */code*, as shown below, runs a number of BayesNetty processes in parallel and sets different output files. As the random number seed is set by default by the execution time, and the processes are set off at the same time, it is necessary to set the seed to different values. The individual average networks are then combined using the *code* collate-average-nets.R */code* R script. Also, R code to plot the average graph is also output, which is modified for the appropriate threshold to plot the edges and the final average network file name.

When there is missing data, the standard approach is to remove every individual with missing data before performing any Bayesian network analysis, and this is the default behaviour.
*

* 
This can be wasteful and undesirable when there are many individuals with missing data, perhaps with only one variable missing, making imputation a natural choice.
*

* 
BayesNetty includes a new imputation method designed to increase the power to detect causal relationships whilst accounting for model uncertainty. This method uses a version of nearest neighbour imputation, whereby missing data from one individual is replaced with data from another individual, the nearest neighbour.
*

* 
An important feature of this approach is that it can be used with both discrete and continuous data.
*
 
*
For each individual with missing data, subsets of variables that can be used to find the nearest neighbour are chosen by bootstrapping the complete data to estimate a Bayesian network. 
*

*/tr*

*/table*

*
The only option that is necessary to impute data is the *code* -impute-network-data */code* option. 
*

*
Once data has been imputed its missing data is filled in with imputed values and any subsequent analyses in BayesNetty will use this imputed data. 
*

*
If an individual has too much missing data then it may not be beneficial to impute the data for this individual, as the imputed data would be too poor to add value to any analysis. The *code* -impute-network-min-non-missing-edges */code* allows the user to change the required amount of edges between non-missing variables to impute data for an individual. Around *b* 50 */b* percent has been shown to be a suitable value to impute most individuals whilst effectively discarding individuals with too much missing data, although it may depend on the structure of any fitted networks. If this value is set to 0 then all individuals will have their data imputed, and a value of 100 will result in no data being imputed. If data set has a block of data with non-missing data for only a few variables then it is best to simply remove these individuals before using BayesNetty.
*

*
The *code* -impute-network-data-random-restarts */code* and *code* -impute-network-data-jitter-restarts */code* options can be increased to improve the network search at each step of the algorithm and may potentially increase the quality of the imputed data at the expense of a longer running time.
*

*
The *code* -impute-network-data-start-indiv */code*, *code* -impute-network-data-end-indiv */code* and *code* -impute-network-data-job */code* options may be used to only impute a range of individuals. These options may be useful for large networks to impute data in parallel and then combine later if the data is output to file (see *ref* output-network */ref* to output data). See *ref* impute-parallel-example */ref* for an example. 
*

*
The option *code* -impute-network-data-job */code* can also be used to only impute data for some individuals and makes it easier to split the imputation into a number of jobs.

*
The data is loaded, a search is performed and then the network data is imputed and another search is performed. The run time for performing imputation is longer than most other operations in BayesNetty. This is because, every individual with missing data, we take a 90% sample (without replacement) of the individuals with complete data at the variables of interest. This sampled data set is used to find a best fit network. This best fit network determines the variables that are used to choose the nearest neighbour for the individual with missing data, and then the missing data is filled in from the nearest neighbour.
*

*
There are a lot of individuals with missing data in this example data resulting in the incorrect network being estimated initially but after the data is imputed the correct network is found. That is, the network that the data was simulated from.
*

*
It may be possible that some individuals are not imputed as they have too much missing data, or sometimes only partially imputed if the data is not suitable for the imputation algorithm.

The Unix script *code* runImputeParallel */code*, as shown below, runs a number of BayesNetty processes in parallel and outputs separate data files for different subsets of individuals. As the random number seed is set by default by the execution time, and the processes are set off at the same time, it is necessary to set the seed to different values. The output files are then combined and the data files from separate processes deleted.

*section-title* Estimate Imputation Benefit  */section-title*

*
For a given data set with missing data it is natural to wonder how much benefit imputation brings. We include an option in BayesNetty to attempt to compare different methods of fitting a best fit network to this data set. We use estimates of the recall and precision to compare the methods. The recall is the percentage of edges that were recovered from the simulation model and the precision is the percentage of edges in the fitted model that are in the simulation model. For an edge to be correct it must be in the correct direction. However, if the simulating network has equivalent networks such that some edges may be in either direction, then these edges are considered correct if they are in any direction.
*

*
The method follows these steps:
*

*numlist*

  *item* An initial network is fitted using imputation.
  *item* Data is simulated using this network for the same number of individuals in the original data set.
  *item* A best fit network is found for the full data set.
  *item* The simulated data set has values set to missing as in the original data set.
  *item* Best fit networks are found for this data set using: (i) a reduced data set with only complete data; (ii) data imputation; (iii) data imputation with complete training data.
  *item* Recall and precision are calculated for the 4 different best fit networks against the simulation network.
*/numlist*

*
This method can be repeated a number times as is computationally feasible to take average recall and precision estimates to account for variability in the simulated data. The recall and precision using the full data set gives an estimate of an upper limit of what may feasibly be achieved using data imputation. Comparing the recall and precision of the reduced data set with imputation gives an estimate of the increased benefit of using imputation. Comparing the two imputation methods should show when it is appropriate to use the variant imputation method.
*

*
A major drawback of this estimation method is the obvious fact that we do not know the *q* true */q* network structure of the data, we therefore use an estimated network to simulate the data and hope this is sufficiently close for the results to be useful. In general, we have found that the benefits of imputation are often understated as the simulation network tends to be set without some of the weaker edges that cannot always be detected (when using data sets where we do actually know the *q* true */q* network). Even if we cannot be too sure of the exact gain in benefit of imputation this BayesNetty estimation method can give clear confidence of a benefit when there are large differences (and if the variant method using complete training data performs any better).

*
From the example output we can see that with no imputation the recall is estimated to be 40.91 percent and the precision estimated to be is 61.66 percent, but if the full data were available it would be 90.21 and 95.02 respectively. Using our imputation method the estimated recall and precision is 78.95 and 89.03 respectively, which is quite a large increase. Our variant imputation method with complete training data also increases the recall and precision by quite a lot.
*

*

*

*
Note that the estimation is stochastic due to the stochastic nature of the imputation method, and to a lesser extent the stochastic nature of finding a best fit model, and so rerunning the analyses may results in slightly different estimates.

*
It is possible to calculate the recall and precision of a network against the *q* true */q* network structure. Typically this option will be used when the true network structure is chosen and used to simulate data. A best fit network can then be found for this data and the accuaracy assessed by calculating the recall and precision.  
*

*
For a network the recall is the percentage of edges found from the original true network. The precision is the percentage of edges in the network that are also in the original true network. For an edge to be correct it must be in the correct direction. However, if the true network has equivalent networks such that some edges may be in either direction, then these edges are considered correct if they are in either direction.

It is possible to simulate data for a given network using BayesNetty. The network must be a bnlearn network, see *ref* bnlearn */ref*, and can be set using a network file which has the same format as a posterior file and sets the network structure and the network parameters. Alternatively, rather than reading in a posterior file, the simulating network can be set by first (in the same parameter file) carrying out any analysis task in BayesNetty that results in a bnlearn network with calculated posteriors.

If posteriors are not given then default network node parameters are used to simulate data. The default probabilities for a discrete SNP node are 0.25, 0.5 and 0.25 for levels 0, 1 and 2 respectively. A minor allele frequency of 0.5 would give these probabilites. For a discrete node the levels are given by equal probabilities. For a continuous node the intercept is set to 10 and the coefficients and variance are set to 1.

* This example simulates node data using a given network structure with network parameters. *

*
The network structure with network parameters must be given to simulate network data. These can be set by using a network parameters file which takes the same format as a posterior file and may be quite complex. To create this network parameter file it is therefore recommended to first output a posterior file for the network that you wish to simulate data for and then to edit this posterior file as required.
*

*
To create a network parameter file, *code* example-network-parameters.txt */code*, run the parameter file, *code* paras-make-network-paras.txt */code*:
*

*codeexample*
#input the example network in format 1
-input-network
-input-network-file example-network-sim.dat

#simulate data using default parameters
-simulate-network-data

#calculate the posterior of the network using default parameters
-calc-posterior

#output the posteriors to be used as a network parameters file
-output-posteriors
-output-posteriors-file example-network-parameters.txt
*/codeexample*

*
The example network file, *code* example-network-sim.dat */code*, is in network format 1, see *ref* input-network-formats */ref*, except that extra (optional) node information is given as there is no node data to determine the node type. After each node either *code* |dis.snp */code*, *code* |cts.snp */code*, *code* |dis|2 */code* or *code* |cts */code* may be written to give a discrete SNP node, a continuous SNP node, a discrete node with the number of levels or a continuous node respectively. If the type of node is not set then the node is set to a continuous node. If a discrete node is specified without the number of levels then the number of levels is set to 0. The example network file is as follows.
*

The data was simulated using default network node parameters. The simulated node data and subsequent fitted parameters are thus close to these values.
*

*
The network parameter file, *code* example-network-parameters.txt */code*, can now be edited using parameters of your choice. The mean is not required, this simply reports the mean of the node data for continuous nodes. The *q* Posteriors */q* title in the file is also not required, but these may be left in the file. The levels of discrete nodes are labelled 0, 1, 2 etc. These may be renamed to something more meaningful in this file. For example, for node *q* mood */q* the levels could be renamed *q* sad */q* and *q* happy */q*.
*

*
Finally, network node data may be simulated for a network with chosen network parameters where initially there was no data available for the network.

*
The Markov blanket for a node contains all the variables that shield the node from the rest of the network. This means that the Markov blanket of a node is the only knowledge needed to predict the behaviour of that node and its children. This may be useful for large networks where some nodes are of particular interest. See *cite* bnlearn */cite* for more details.
*

*
The *code* -markov-blanket */code* option can be used to calculate the Markov blanket for a given node. A sub-network is created for the given node and its Markov blanket which may be output using the *code* -output-network */code* option, see *ref* output-network */ref*, or used in any other network analysis.

**********************
*subsection*

* 
The Markov blanket for a given node is calculated by using the *code* -markov-blanket */code* option together with the *code* -markov-blanket-node-name */code* option to choose the node. For example:
*

*codeexample*
#input the example network
-input-network
-input-network-file example-network-format1.dat

#calculate the Markov Blanket
-markov-blanket
-markov-blanket-node-name express

#output the network
-output-network
-output-network-file express-markov-blanket.dat
*/codeexample*


*
As the Markov blanket does not depend on the data of the nodes it is possible to calculate the Markov blanket without data. In the example the network structure is input, the Markov blanket calculated for the *q* express */q* node and then output to the file *code* express-markov-blanket.dat */code*. This parameter file, *code* paras-blanket.txt */code*, can be found in *html* <a href="example.zip">example.zip</a>&nbsp; */html* *tex* example.zip */tex* and produces output which should look something as follows:

The following is an example parameter file to output the necessary files to plot the network in R with the igraph package. BayesNetty uses the input data and the input network to calculate for each edge a chi squared value, representing twice the difference in log likelihoods between the network where the edge is present and the network where it is absent.

The data is loaded, the network input and output to 2 separate files, one containing the node data and another containing the edge data.
*

*
There is also an R file which is output which will look something as follows:
*

*codeexample*
#load igraph library, http://igraph.org/r/
library(igraph)

#load network graph
nodes<-read.table("exampleGraph-nodes.dat", header=TRUE)
edges<-read.table("exampleGraph-edges.dat", header=TRUE)

#create graph
graph<-graph_from_data_frame(edges, directed = TRUE, vertices = nodes)

#plot the network and output png file, edit style as required

#style for continuous nodes
shape<-rep("circle", length(nodes$type))
vcolor<-rep("#eeeeee", length(nodes$type))
vsize<-rep(25, length(nodes$type))
color<-rep("black", length(nodes$type))

#style for discrete nodes
shape[nodes$type=="d"]<-"rectangle"
vcolor[nodes$type=="d"]<-"#111111"
vsize[nodes$type=="d"]<-20
color[nodes$type=="d"]<-"white"

#style for factor nodes
shape[nodes$type=="f"]<-"rectangle"
vcolor[nodes$type=="f"]<-"#eeeeee"
vsize[nodes$type=="f"]<-20
color[nodes$type=="f"]<-"black"

#edge widths for significances
minWidth<-0.3
maxWidth<-10
edgeMax<-max(edges$chisq)
edgeMin<-min(edges$chisq)
widths<-((edges$chisq-edgeMin)/(edgeMax-edgeMin))*(maxWidth - minWidth) + minWidth
styles<-rep(1, length(widths))

#plot to a png file
png(filename="exampleGraph.png", width=800, height=800)

plot(graph, vertex.shape=shape, vertex.size=vsize, vertex.color=vcolor, vertex.label.color=color, edge.width=widths, edge.lty=styles, edge.color="black", edge.arrow.size=1.5)

#finish png file
dev.off()
*/codeexample*

*
This R file can be ran as follows in Linux
*

*codeexample*
R --vanilla < exampleGraph-plot.R
*/codeexample*

*
and produces the .png image file of the network
*


*figure* exampleGraph.png

*caption* Plot of the example network drawn using the igraph R package.
*/caption*
*label* plot1-fig */label*
*width* 700 */width*
*widthtex* 400 */widthtex*
*/figure*

*
The edges are drawn proportional to the log likelihood difference between networks with and without the edge in question. The minimum and maximum thickness of the plotted edges can be changed by modifying the *code* minWidth */code* and *code* maxWidth */code* variables in the R file. The plot can easily be updated to your needs by following the *html* <a href="http://igraph.org">igraph</a>&nbsp; */html* *tex* igraph */tex* R package documentation. 
*

*
If a search is performed to find the best network (see parameter file *code* paras-plot-network2.txt */code*), it can be plotted as above and gives the following network:
*

*figure* exampleGraph2.png

*caption* Plot of the best fit network drawn using the igraph R package.
