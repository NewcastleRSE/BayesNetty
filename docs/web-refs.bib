    abstract = {Author summary Mendelian randomization (MR) is a popular method for inferring causal relationships between variables (such as between an intermediate biological factor and a disease outcome). However, MR relies on a number of assumptions that may be hard to verify, and it is not ideally suited to comparing different underlying causal scenarios. Here we propose the use of an alternative approach, Bayesian network analysis (BN), as a complementary tool to conventional MR. We use real and simulated data to investigate the performance of MR, BN and several other recently-proposed methods, and find that BN performs as well as, or better than, the other methods, particularly under complex scenarios. We conclude that BN is a useful complementary approach to conventional MR for exploring causal relationships in complex data sets.},

We review the frequentist and Bayesian ideas underlying model selection, which serve as an introduction to the rest of this special issue on �All models are wrong...�, a workshop under the same name was held in March 2011 in Groningen to critically examined the field of statistical model selection methods over the past 40 years. We briefly introduce the philosophical debate that is concerned with model selection. We present the results of a questionnaire that was distributed under the participants of the workshop, showing that the field has not yet reached a comforting consensus and is still in full swing.},
