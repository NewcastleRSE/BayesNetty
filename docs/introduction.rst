The **recommended use** of BayesNetty is to calculate the average network as described in the :ref:`Average Network<average-network>` section,
possibly additionally using imputation to fill in missing data as descibed in :ref:`Impute Data<impute-data>` section.
However, for new users we recommend you work your way through all sections in numerical order,
in order to understand the functionality of the program.
